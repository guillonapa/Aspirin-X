        <p class="card-text" style="text-align: justify">We understand that learning is an active process. Specially in computer science, students need to get hands-on experience. You try, you fail, and you repeat until you succeed. AspirinX is a cloud application where students can complete programming assignments, run tests against their solution, and track their own progress.</p>

        <p class="card-text" style="text-align: justify">AspirinX is for both students and teachers. Through a seamless user interface, teachers can create new programming assignments and generate templates for students to follow. Tests can be provided to help the student achieve a correct solution, and further tests can be added for scoring purposes. A teacher can track the progress of the students and obtain revealing statistics that can be used to boost the learning process.</p>
